## üìò Project Overview
Hospital readmissions are a critical issue for both healthcare providers and patients, particularly among diabetic individuals who face complex care requirements.  
This project presents a **Healthcare Readmission System**, a predictive machine learning solution designed to analyze patient data and forecast the likelihood of hospital readmission.  

By combining structured medical data with interactive analytics through **Streamlit**, the system provides valuable insights that can support hospitals in identifying at-risk patients, optimizing treatment strategies, and improving healthcare outcomes.

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze hospital readmission patterns among diabetic patients.
- Preprocess and clean hospital datasets for reliable model training.
- Identify the most influential factors contributing to readmission.
- Develop and evaluate machine learning models for prediction accuracy.
- Deploy the best-performing model through an interactive **Streamlit** web interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture
The system is divided into two key components:

### üß© 1. Model Development (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering.  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.  
- Training and evaluation of various machine learning models (e.g., CatBoost, LightGBM).  
- Selection of the top-performing model based on AUC, F1-score, and accuracy metrics.
- Further Hypertuning of the top perfomring models to test for higher performance. 

### üíª 2. Streamlit Application
- User-friendly interface for both individual and batch predictions.  
- Real-time classification of diabetic patients based on input data.  
- Visual representation of results through charts and confusion matrices.  
- Downloadable reports and sample CSV for easy testing.

## üß† Methodology (CRISP-DM)
1. **Data Acquisition:** Hospital readmission dataset containing patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and admission details.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling of missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.  
3. **Feature Selection:** Identification of top 10 predictive features for model optimization.  
4. **Model Training:** Comparison between multiple algorithms (LightGBM, Decision Tree, CatBoost, ANN's etc.).  
5. **Evaluation:** Models assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.  
6. **Deployment:** Integration of the best model (LightGBM) into a Streamlit web app.
